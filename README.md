# discord-radio-bot
Simple bot

TODO:
- Automatic selecting of random person every hour
- Menu with help and leaderboards
- Counter of the number of times someone was selected 
- Spreadsheet of all music uploaded by people (it should check if someone sends a spotify link and then add it to the spreadsheet), I guess that I should use one of google's API's to do that
